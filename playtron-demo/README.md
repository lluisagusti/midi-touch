# Playtron Touch 🎹🍍

**Turn the world into your orchestra.**

> *Current Branch: `dev` - Where the magic happens (and sometimes breaks).*

Welcome to the **Playtron Touch Demo**. This isn't just a piano; it's a portal. A portal where pineapples play jazz, spoons drop beats, and your own fingers become the conductor of a digital symphony.

Built for the **Playtronica Playtron**, this web app transforms simple touch into rich, textured sound. It's safe, it's stylish, and it's ready to make your desk weird.

## 🚀 Experience It

1.  **Plug In**: Connect your [Playtron](https://playtronica.com/) via USB.
2.  **Clip On**: Attach alligator clips to anything conductive.
    *   **Pro Tip**: Water = Conductor. Cats = Not recommended (too fast).
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  **Touch**: Touch the objects and watch the screen come alive.

## 🔮 The Vibe

We've ditched the boring buttons for a **2024 Glassmorphism** aesthetic. Deep space gradients meet reactive neon that pulses with every note. It’s responsive, fluid, and designed to look as good as your music sounds (even if your music is just banging on a cucumber).

### Features
*   **Virtual Piano**: A visual synthesizer that mirrors your physical connections.
*   **Sample Grid**: Punchy drum pads for when you need to drop a beat on a banana.
*   **Audio Engine**: Powered by **Tone.js** for low-latency, high-fidelity synthesis.
*   **Plug & Play**: Works instantly with the Web MIDI API. No drivers, no fuss.

## 💡 Creative Cookbook
*Things we've tested so you don't have to (but you should):*

*   **The Salad Symphony**: Connect 4 different vegetables. Play a healthy beat.
*   **The H2O Flow**: Bowls of water with food coloring. Dip fingers for ambient swells.
*   **High-Five Hive**: Connect clips to your friends (hold the metal bit). High-five to trigger samples.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Vite + React**: Rendering faster than you can say "latency".
*   **Tone.js**: The brain behind the bleeps and bloops.
*   **Framer Motion**: Making things move like butter.
*   **Web MIDI API**: The bridge between the digital and the physical.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **No Sound?**: Click the "Start Experience" button. Browsers hate auto-playing audio (for good reason).
*   **No MIDI?**: Make sure your cable is good. Wiggle it. If that fails, blame the USB port.
