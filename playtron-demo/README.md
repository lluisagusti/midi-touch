# Playtron Touch 🎹🍍

**Turn the world into your orchestra.**

Welcome to the **Playtron Touch Demo**. This isn't just a piano; it's a portal. A portal where pineapples play jazz, spoons drop beats, and your own fingers become the conductor of a digital symphony.

Built for the **Playtronica Playtron**, this web app transforms simple touch into rich, textured sound. It's safe, it's stylish, and it's ready to make your desk weird.
